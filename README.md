# Windows_KeyLogger
its a keylogger for windows which sends an email with all the keys logged. Written in c# using 
visual studio 2015 community edition.
if some one can modify it for reading from config.xml file so that email, password and time delays can be set using this 
config file .

this code was modified to make it usable on weekends and non office hours so that it doesnt send mails or 
log anything during that period. so that the system/office network doesn't find any clue and then it sends details later
(it can be modified to log and send mails all the time.) enjoy hacking.
